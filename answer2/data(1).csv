description,"Assume I have rest pathrest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute"");

rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");
And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:/test:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'
However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme 
/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
             type : 'string'
             format : 'com.ClassB'
However I'd expect it to be:/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB'
