description,"Assume I have rest pathrest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute"");

rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");
And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:/test:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'
However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme 
/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
             type : 'string'
             format : 'com.ClassB'
However I'd expect it to be:/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB'

https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny
CamelMutiny.on(context)
    .toMulti(servicenow().table(""incident"").max(100))
    .then(m -> doSomething(m))

In Quarkus, we can nicely integrate camel into reactive messaging, like:
@Inject
CamelMutiny mutiny;

@Outgoing
Multi<Whatever> fromEndpoint() {
    return mutiny.toMulti(servicenow().table(""incident"").max(100));
}
@Outgoing
Multi<Whatever> fromEndpointURI() {
    return mutiny.toMulti(""servicenow?table=incident"");
}

@Incoming
void toEndpoint(Multi<Item> items) {
    return mutiny.subscribeTo(items)
        .with(servicenow().table(""incident"").max(100).async());

description,"What do you think about adding a consumerTag to the Camel RabbitMQ endpoint ?The consumerTag allows you to specify a client-generated consumer tag to establish context when invoking channel.basicConsume(). This function is useful from an operational point of view to specialize the names of consumers in the RabbitMQ management console. See attachments.
String basicConsume(String queue, boolean autoAck, String consumerTag, boolean noLocal, boolean exclusive, Map<String, Object> arguments, Consumer callback) throws IOException;The evolution to realize is simple.1/ Add the consumerTag in the RabbitMQEndpoint class:
@UriParam (label = ""consumer"")
private String consumerTag = """";2/ Use the consumerTag in the RabbitConsumer class:
@Override
protected void doStart () throws Exception {
   if (channel == null) {
      throw new IOException (""The RabbitMQ channel is not open"");
   }
   tag = channel.basicConsume (consumer.getEndpoint(). getQueue(), consumer.getEndpoint().isAutoAck(), consumer.getEndpoint().getConsumerTag(), false, consumer.getEndpoint().isExclusiveConsumer(), null, this);
 }NB : This functionnality exists on Spring AMQP through the org.springframework.amqp.support.ConsumerTagStrategy interface."

polls. So we could look into one that does that, and do a full scan of
all the files, and then do a change detect on all files all together
and make up which ones hasn't changed. And that way can react faster
than currently.Now that may require doing more file directory listings to gather all
those files and their timestamps / size to see which one has changed,
instead of monitoring a single file one by one. Also it may mean that
files can be processed out of order, if a file sort isn't must be
strictly followed."

description,"The OpenTracing SpecialAgent includes support for the Apache Camel OpenTracing component. Since the release of Camel v3.0.0, the integration fails to install.For previous versions of Camel, the SpecialAgent has used the  `InstallOpenTracingTracerRuleTest` to assert that the Camel OpenTracing component works with SpecialAgent.Since the release of Camel v3.0.0, the `InstallOpenTracingTracerRuleTest` that is in Camel's GitHub has been marked with `@Ignore`. When I remove the `@Ignore` annotation, the test fails. I am not experienced with the Camel OpenTracing component to attempt to debug this issue.Currently, SpecialAgent integrates the Camel OpenTracing component for versions 2.24.0 to 2.24.2. Does the Apache Camel team desire integration of the Camel 3.0.0 OpenTracing component in SpecialAgent? "
